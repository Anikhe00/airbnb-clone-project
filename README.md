### The Importance of Identifying Design Properties of a Mock-Up Design
Identifying design properties in a mockup is crucial because it ensures **clarity**, **consistency**, and **accuracy** between the design and development phases. It helps teams maintain a **unified visual language**, **improves usability**, and **reduces errors or rework**. By defining details such as **colours**, **fonts**, **spacing**, and **hierarchy**, mockups become precise blueprints that facilitate faster, cheaper, and more consistent implementation with the intended user experience.
